# Debugging JavaScript
This repository was created for the purpose of allowing student to practice their debugging skills.

## Overview
EXPECTATION: You will be expected to fully engage during lecture periods. Accordingly, please wait until the designated times during this live workshop to explore the exercises. You will be given 10-15 minutes per section, so please pace yourself accordingly.

NEED HELP? Practice developing your autonomy as a programmer. Use Google Search, Medium, Hackernoon. MDN, Stack Overflow, peruse documentation at mdn.io, or talk to your friendly neighbor. If you're utterly stuck, flag down your instructor for guidance.

DISCLAIMER: Completion of this workshop is no guarantee of admission into the Hack Reactor immersive program, nor does it have any influence in the admissions process.

Refer to the following website for JavaScript styling and clean code [here](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

## Debugging Process
---
1. Reproduce the bug before you start changing code
2. Understand stack traces from error messages
3. Write unit tests that reproduces the bug
4. Recognize and know your error codes
5. GOOGLE!  DUCK DUCK GO!
6. Pair program with others/Whiteboard
7. Celebrate and Live to see another day!!! 



## Thinking about JavaScript
---
### Reasoning Methods
As you embark on your learning journey, a sound method for thinking about JavaScript will be to consider each line of code as a discrete instruction being provided to your computer.

* What is each line of code intended to do individually?
* How about when combined together?

It will be beneficial for your growth as a sophisticated programmer to think deeply about the intentions of your code so you can predict and understand the behavior your program produces.

* What is the expected output of the code?
* Why will the code produce the output that I expect?

Thinking about each line of code can take many shapes:

* How is this line of code structured and why?
* What syntax rules is this line of code following? Not following?
* Where is this line of code located contextually within the program?
* What references is this line of code making to other parts of the program? Are such references sound?

### Vocabulary Development

Developing your vocabulary as a programmer is as important as learning to write code. To accelerate your conversational capabilities, we recommend partnering with a neighbor to discuss your code at every opportunity. The more opportunities you have to explain yourself, the better. Don't worry â€“ with time, the ambiguity with which you presently speak about code will transform into eloquent prose.
